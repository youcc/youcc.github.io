Hi!

I'm Chad You, Sr Database Administrator at [VUMC Health Policy](https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/welcome-health-policy), where I lead the Research Data Core team.

If you'd like to learn more about what I do, check out one of my projects:

-   [Healthcare Analytics Handbook](https://github.com/youcc/healthcare_analytics_handbook), is the place to start if you want to learn how to do analytics in healthcare. 

-   [Today I Learned](https://github.com/youcc/til).

Outside of work, I love to practice Aikido at [Nashville Aikikai](https://nashvilleaikikai.org/).
